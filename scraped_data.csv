15,the airline industry was once flying high both literally and metaphorically
16,the demand for air travel was touching the sky and everything looked so hunky dory
17,fliers were getting value for money and the industry felt on cloud nine
18,and then covid happened
19,it changed everything overnight
20,travel restrictions were imposed and it saw a big surge in cancellations that brought some really serious challenges for customer service teams
21,obviously the pandemic also necessitated the need for new measures in servicing customers and meeting their needs in the changed circumstances
22,with the changed scenario it was also time to set examples of excellent customer service in the airline industry
23,it was perhaps the time to show the world how the aviation industry was meant to fly always
24,and the industry took the challenge on its chin and rose to the occasion like never before
25,the great customer service that the airline sector is synonymous with was restored and gradually things started getting back to normal
26,the dangers may not have subsided completely but the turnaround in servicing customers is surely the milestone of recent times
27,in this blog post we will look at some of the great examples of customer service for both pre and post pandemic times and see how they impact ed the flying experience
28,but before moving ahead with the main theme it would be good if we understood the need for customer service in the aviation sector and analyzed its deep impact on the industry
29,what makes customer service excellent for the airline industry more than of companies across industries now compete mainly on the basis of customer experience and the airline industry is no different
30,having said that many elements obviously make up the crux of great customer service for the airline industry that can make or break the kind of experience fliers will have with an airline
31,in general excellent customer service in the airline industry constitutes these aspects including ease of booking tickets customer experience starts with the ticket booking stage itself
32,and when a flier finds it easy to reserve their seat on the flight it should be considered good service
33,use of digital technology in delivering tickets on mobile now when of companies focusing on the mobile customer experience few airlines still play by the old rule and send the booked tickets to the mail
34,only some are using digital technology to deliver the tickets across channels particularly on whatsapp and making things easier for customers
35,hassles with check in process no flier would wish to face hassles with the check in process but the reality is far from different
36,from calling passengers hours in advance to delaying the check in process in the name of documentation a lot can dilute the great experience flyers expect with an airline
37,time taken in handing over the boarding pass yes the more time an airline takes in handing over the boarding pass the more likely it is to frustrate the fliers
38,crew s behavior towards the passenger during a flight a passenger may face various types of problems be it related to seating arrangement or some request to food etc
39,it s ultimately the crew s expertise and behavior in handling those matters that decide the level of customer experience for passengers
40,the kind of food provided during the flight food quality can also adversely impact the level and kind of in flight customer service delivered to fliers
41,delays in picking up the luggage at the destination ideally a flyer should collect their luggage upon arrival within minutes so that they can make a breezy exit out of the airport
42,but not many airlines pay heed to this important aspect and thus they compromise the customer experience big time
43,importance of customer service in the airline industrybooking a flight and flying to some destination has always been seen as a privilege
44,it s a kind of luxury that most of us secretly wish to afford on a regular basis
45,and those who do often develop a taste that gradually morphs into lofty expectations
46,and airlines must meet those airy expectations in the form of excellent customer service to make the journey a truly once in a life experience for flyers
47,maybe this deeply ingrained need to feel special while flying has something to do with the great customer service that is always expected of the airline industry
48,but yes delivering excellent customer service also has a huge role to play in the success of the aviation industry
49,the role of customer service is indeed big for airlines for many reasons including the market is ultra competitive competition is immense in the airline industry where new ventures hit the ground running on a regular basis
50,customer service emerges as the key differentiator between good and average companies in this cut throat atmosphere
51,customer loyalty matters when a flier gets a good experience at every stage of their journey with the airline they feel happy and it creates good word of mouth for the business
52,the flier then becomes a repeat customer and this is how servicing could lead to building brand loyalty for the business
53,good customer service adds value the scope of good customer service goes way beyond just guiding the passenger to their seat and providing them the food on time
54,fliers will feel great if the crew goes above the board in taking care of their in transit needs and making their journey as comfortable as it can get
55,revenue is based on the kind of customer service delivered when an airline delivers great customer service the impact is often visible to the bottom line
56,it then gets repeat customers which eventually adds to the revenue
57,some examples of excellent customer service in the airline industry the airline industry is always synonymous with amazing customer service
58,right from the early days flying was considered a luxury purely for the kind of experiences made available to fliers
59,the trend of pampering the fliers is still in vogue though cases of an extreme and innovative form of customer service are only few and far between
60,some examples of excellent customer service in the airline industry include
61,united airlines holds plane to help a passenger say goodbye to his dying mother when we talk about customer service in the airline industry nothing could beat the example that united airlines set in
62,the airline not only redefined the meaning of customer service but also went way beyond what any other organization would do
63,as was the case one fine morning a passenger named kerry drake got the information that her mother was seriously ill and probably facing her final hours
64,so he caught the next flight from san francisco to lubbock texas via houston
65,however when his first flight was delayed he literally broke down in tears on the plane itself knowing he would not make it in time to catch the connecting flight
66,when the flight crew came to know about him and his condition they spoke to the captain who then spoke further to the concerned personnel of the next flight to delay the flight
67,and finally the passenger was able to get on board and see his mother before she passed away
68,alaska airlines adopts omnichannel approach for customer communication flying with alaska airlines is nothing less than a treat and flyers who have availed it services always swear by the creative ways it uses for boosting in flight customer experience

70,so what does it mean to understand the point well you should know how whenever someone heads to the alaska airlines website they find various ways to help
71,from an faq page to access a mobile app and a direct line to the service team
72,on top of that their website also has a twitter account info with a dedicated team
73,they don t stop here the airline has an open csat survey on the website

76,british airways rises above cabin distinction and provides reading materials to all treating every passenger equally is always the hallmark of quality customer service
77,however in the airline industry where cabin barrier often defines the quality of service british airways is one company that rises above the class barrier and provides quality reading material to everyone on board
78,while many airlines pamper their business class flyers with tons of amenities and facilities they often don t maintain the same level of standards with the economy class
79,this is where the step by british airways to provide free reading material to all passengers makes a cut
80,so irrespective of the cabin of travel any flyer can pick newspapers and magazines near the boarding gate and get something to complement their journey well

85,once the support team of tap airline did the unthinkable and went one step further rather than waiting for the passenger to call one agent took it upon himself to reach out to the troubled person and help him through the issue
86,it all started when the person in question faced difficulty in booking a ticket as the website rejected three of his attempts while filling up the credit card details
87,frustrated he decided to seek help and then dialed up the service team and hoped for a long wait before getting some response
88,to his surprise the service team rep called back immediately on his phone and provided help as needed
89,this aptly shows how great examples of customer service in the airline industry do exist today as well
