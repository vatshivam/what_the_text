The demand for air travel was touching the sky and everything looked so hunky-dory. Fliers were getting value for money and the industry felt on cloud nine. </span><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then Covid-19 happened. It changed everything overnight. Travel restrictions were imposed and it saw a big surge in cancellations that brought some really serious challenges for customer service teams. Obviously, the pandemic also necessitated the need for new measures in servicing customers and meeting their needs in the changed circumstances. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the changed scenario, it was also time to set examples of excellent customer service in the airline industry. It was perhaps the time to show the world how the aviation industry was meant to fly, always. And the industry took the challenge on its chin and rose to the occasion like never before. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The great customer service that the airline sector is synonymous with was restored and gradually things started getting back to normal. The dangers may not have subsided completely but the turnaround in servicing customers is surely the milestone of recent times. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this blog post, we will look at some of the great examples of customer service for both pre and post-pandemic times and see how they impact/ed the flying experience. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But before moving ahead with the main theme, it would be good if we understood the need for customer service in the aviation sector and analyzed its deep impact on the industry. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Makes Customer Service Excellent for the Airline Industry? </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">66% of companies</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> across industries now compete mainly on the basis of customer experience, and the airline industry is no different. Having said that, many elements obviously make up the crux of great customer service for the airline industry that can make or break the kind of experience fliers will have with an airline. </span></p><p><img alt=\"what_makes_customer_service_excellent_for_the_airline_industry\" class=\"wp-image-233013 aligncenter\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.revechat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/what_makes_customer_service_excellent_for_the_airline_industry.png\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"600\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20710%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"710\"/><noscript><img alt=\"what_makes_customer_service_excellent_for_the_airline_industry\" class=\"wp-image-233013 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.revechat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/what_makes_customer_service_excellent_for_the_airline_industry.png\" width=\"710\"/></noscript></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In general, excellent customer service in the airline industry constitutes these aspects, including – </span></p><ul>\n",
      "<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Ease of booking tickets</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – Customer experience starts with the ticket booking stage itself. And when a flier finds it easy to reserve their seat on the flight, it should be considered good service. </span></li>\n",
      "<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Use of digital technology in delivering tickets on mobile</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> –  Now when </span><a href=\"https://www.superoffice.com/blog/customer-experience-statistics/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"84% of companies\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">84% of companies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> focusing on the mobile customer experience, few airlines still play by the old rule and send the booked tickets to the mail. Only some are using digital technology to deliver the tickets across channels, particularly on WhatsApp, and making things easier for customers.  </span></li>\n",
      "<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Hassles with check-in process</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – No flier would wish to face hassles with the check-in process but the reality is far from different. From calling passengers hours in advance to delaying the check-in process in the name of documentation, a lot can dilute the great experience flyers expect with an airline. </span></li>\n",
      "<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Time taken in handing over the boarding pass</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – Yes, the more time an airline takes in handing over the boarding pass, the more likely it is to frustrate the fliers. </span></li>\n",
      "<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Crew’s behavior towards the passenger </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– During a flight, a passenger may face various types of problems, be it related to seating arrangement or some request to food, etc. It’s ultimately the crew’s expertise and behavior in handling those matters that decide the level of </span><a href=\"https://www.revechat.com/blog/customer-service-tips/\" title=\"customer experience\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">customer experience</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for passengers. </span></li>\n",
      "<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>The kind of food provided during the flight </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– Food quality can also adversely impact the level and kind of in-flight customer service delivered to fliers.  </span></li>\n",
      "<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Delays in picking up the luggage at the destination</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–  Ideally, a flyer should collect their luggage upon arrival within minutes so that they can make a breezy exit out of the airport. But not many airlines pay heed to this important aspect and thus they compromise the customer experience big time.  </span></li>\n",
      "</ul><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Importance of Customer Service in the Airline Industry</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Booking a flight and flying to some destination has always been seen as a privilege. It’s a kind of luxury that most of us secretly wish to afford on a regular basis. And those who do often develop a taste that gradually morphs into lofty expectations. And airlines must meet those airy expectations in the form of </span><a href=\"https://www.revechat.com/blog/customer-service-examples/\" title=\"excellent customer service\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">excellent customer service</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to make the journey a truly once-in-a-life experience for flyers. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe this deeply-ingrained need to feel special while flying has something to do with the great customer service that is always expected of the airline industry. But yes, delivering excellent customer service also has a huge role to play in the success of the aviation industry. </span></p><p><img alt=\"importance_of_customer_service_in_the_airline_industry\" class=\"size-full wp-image-233014 aligncenter\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.revechat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/importance_of_customer_service_in_the_airline_industry.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"365\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20365'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"800\"/><noscript><img alt=\"importance_of_customer_service_in_the_airline_industry\" class=\"size-full wp-image-233014 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"365\" src=\"https://www.revechat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/importance_of_customer_service_in_the_airline_industry.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></noscript></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The role of customer service is indeed big for airlines for many reasons, including – </span></p><p> </p><p><b>The market is ultra-competitive </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– Competition is immense in the airline industry where new ventures hit the ground running on a regular basis. Customer service emerges as the key differentiator between good and average companies in this cut-throat atmosphere. </span></p><p><b>Customer loyalty matters</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – When a flier gets a good experience at every stage of their journey with the airline, they feel happy and it creates good word-of-mouth for the business. The flier then becomes a repeat customer and this is how servicing could lead to </span><a href=\"https://www.revechat.com/blog/increase-customer-loyalty/\" title=\"building brand loyalty\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">building brand loyalty</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the business. </span></p><p><b>Good customer service adds value</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – The scope of good customer service goes way beyond just guiding the passenger to their seat and providing them the food on time. Fliers will feel great if the crew goes above the board in taking care of their in-transit needs and making their journey as comfortable as it can get. </span></p><p><b>Revenue is based on the kind of customer service delivered</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> –  When an airline delivers great customer service, the impact is often visible to the bottom line. It then gets repeat customers which eventually adds to the revenue. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some Examples of Excellent Customer Service in the Airline Industry </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The airline industry is always synonymous with amazing customer service. Right from the early days, flying was considered a luxury purely for the kind of experiences made available to fliers. The trend of pampering the fliers is still in vogue though cases of an extreme and </span><a href=\"https://www.revechat.com/blog/customer-experience-examples/\" title=\"innovative form of customer service\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">innovative form of customer service</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are only few and far between.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some examples of excellent customer service in the airline industry include</span></p><p> </p><h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. United Airlines Holds Plane to Help a Passenger Say Goodbye to His Dying Mother </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we talk about customer service in the airline industry, nothing could beat the </span><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/united-airlines-holds-plane_b_2820787\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"example that United Airlines set in 2013\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">example that United Airlines set in 2013</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The airline not only redefined the meaning of customer service but also went way beyond what any other organization would do.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As was the case, one fine morning, a passenger named Kerry Drake got the information that her mother was seriously ill and probably facing her final hours. So, he caught the next flight from San Francisco to Lubbock, Texas, via Houston. However, when his first flight was delayed, he literally broke down in tears on the plane itself, knowing he would not make it in time to catch the connecting flight. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the flight crew came to know about him and his condition, they spoke to the captain who then spoke further to the concerned personnel of the next flight to delay the flight. And finally, the passenger was able to get on board and see his mother before she passed away. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Alaska Airlines Adopts Omnichannel Approach For Customer Communication  </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flying with Alaska Airlines is nothing less than a treat and flyers who have availed it services always swear by the creative ways it uses for boosting in-flight customer experience. And if that was not enough, the airlines is among the few in the industry to use omnichannel communication for customer communication.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what does it mean? </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To understand the point well, you should know how whenever someone heads to the Alaska Airlines website they find various ways to help. From an FAQ page to access a mobile app, and a direct line to the service team. On top of that, their website also has a Twitter account info with a dedicated 24×7 team.</span></p><p><img alt=\"alsaka_airlines\" class=\"wp-image-233019 aligncenter\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.revechat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/alsaka_airlines.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"337\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20337'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"800\"/><noscript><img alt=\"alsaka_airlines\" class=\"wp-image-233019 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"337\" src=\"https://www.revechat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/alsaka_airlines.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></noscript></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They don’t stop here – the airline has an open </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSAT survey on the website</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And they use multiple channels to ask for customer satisfaction surveys. All this makes communication absolutely seamless for customers as they can easily reach the service team from their channel of choice and get help as and when needed.   </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. British Airways Rises Above Cabin Distinction and Provides Reading Materials to All </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Treating every passenger equally is always the hallmark of quality customer service. However, in the airline industry where cabin barrier often defines the quality of service, British Airways is one company that rises above the class barrier and provides quality reading material to everyone on board. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many airlines pamper their business-class flyers with tons of amenities and facilities, they often don’t maintain the same level of standards with the Economy class. This is where </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the step by British Airways to provide free reading material</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to all passengers makes a cut. </span></p><p><img alt=\"bristish-airways-crew\" class=\"wp-image-233024 aligncenter\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.revechat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bristish-airways-crew.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"240\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20639%20240'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"639\"/><noscript><img alt=\"bristish-airways-crew\" class=\"wp-image-233024 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://www.revechat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bristish-airways-crew.jpg\" width=\"639\"/></noscript></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, irrespective of the cabin of travel, any flyer can pick newspapers and magazines near the boarding gate and get something to complement their journey well. And by making available the materials at the gate, the airline leaves it up to the passenger to choose rather than distributing themselves as it could be another hassle they avoid. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Portuguese National Airline, TAP, Reaches Out to a Customer Having Issues with Booking </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reaching out to an airline customer service agent via phone can be a painful experience. Sometimes it might take an eternity to have someone pick up your call and respond. But the case with the Portuguese National Airline, TAP, was different. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the </span><a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/an-extraordinary-incredible-example-of-customer-service-yes-from-an-airline/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"support team of TAP airline\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">support team of TAP airline</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> did the unthinkable and went one step further – rather than waiting for the passenger to call, one agent took it upon himself to reach out to the troubled person and help him through the issue. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It all started when the person in question faced difficulty in booking a ticket as the website rejected three of his attempts while filling up the credit card details. Frustrated, he decided to seek help and then dialed up the service team and hoped for a long wait before getting some response.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To his surprise, the service team rep called back immediately on his phone and provided help as needed. This aptly shows how great examples of customer service in the airline industry do exist today as well. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Qatar Airways Creates a Fun and Engaging In-flight Environment for Kids </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flying with kids can be tough. And when it’s a long-haul flight, you can expect the plight to be even worse for parents. Not only parents, but kids can sometimes create problems for co-passengers as well. Cases are galore where some unruly youngsters and their antics made the entire journey bad for everyone. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qatar Airways understands that risk and maybe that’s why its customer service attempts on the long-route network consider kids and their needs as well. It knows how kids often feel bored on a long flight in the lack of any activity beyond mobile entertainment.

      "the airline industry was once flying high both literally and metaphorically. the demand for air travel was touching the sky and everything looked so hunky dory. fliers were getting value for money and the industry felt on cloud nine. and then covid happened. it changed everything overnight. travel restrictions were imposed and it saw a big surge in cancellations that brought some really serious challenges for customer service teams. obviously the pandemic also necessitated the need for new measures in servicing customers and meeting their needs in the changed circumstances. with the changed scenario it was also time to set examples of excellent customer service in the airline industry. it was perhaps the time to show the world how the aviation industry was meant to fly always. and the industry took the challenge on its chin and rose to the occasion like never before. the great customer service that the airline sector is synonymous with was restored and gradually things started getting back to normal. the dangers may not have subsided completely but the turnaround in servicing customers is surely the milestone of recent times. in this blog post we will look at some of the great examples of customer service for both pre and post pandemic times and see how they impact ed the flying experience. but before moving ahead with the main theme it would be good if we understood the need for customer service in the aviation sector and analyzed its deep impact on the industry. what makes customer service excellent for the airline industry more than of companies across industries now compete mainly on the basis of customer experience and the airline industry is no different. having said that many elements obviously make up the crux of great customer service for the airline industry that can make or break the kind of experience fliers will have with an airline. in general excellent customer service in the airline industry constitutes these aspects including ease of booking tickets customer experience starts with the ticket booking stage itself. and when a flier finds it easy to reserve their seat on the flight it should be considered good service. use of digital technology in delivering tickets on mobile now when of companies focusing on the mobile customer experience few airlines still play by the old rule and send the booked tickets to the mail. only some are using digital technology to deliver the tickets across channels particularly on whatsapp and making things easier for customers. hassles with check in process no flier would wish to face hassles with the check in process but the reality is far from different. from calling passengers hours in advance to delaying the check in process in the name of documentation a lot can dilute the great experience flyers expect with an airline. time taken in handing over the boarding pass yes the more time an airline takes in handing over the boarding pass the more likely it is to frustrate the fliers. crew s behavior towards the passenger during a flight a passenger may face various types of problems be it related to seating arrangement or some request to food etc. it s ultimately the crew s expertise and behavior in handling those matters that decide the level of customer experience for passengers. the kind of food provided during the flight food quality can also adversely impact the level and kind of in flight customer service delivered to fliers. delays in picking up the luggage at the destination ideally a flyer should collect their luggage upon arrival within minutes so that they can make a breezy exit out of the airport. but not many airlines pay heed to this important aspect and thus they compromise the customer experience big time. importance of customer service in the airline industrybooking a flight and flying to some destination has always been seen as a privilege. it s a kind of luxury that most of us secretly wish to afford on a regular basis. and those who do often develop a taste that gradually morphs into lofty expectations. and airlines must meet those airy expectations in the form of excellent customer service to make the journey a truly once in a life experience for flyers. maybe this deeply ingrained need to feel special while flying has something to do with the great customer service that is always expected of the airline industry. but yes delivering excellent customer service also has a huge role to play in the success of the aviation industry. the role of customer service is indeed big for airlines for many reasons including the market is ultra competitive competition is immense in the airline industry where new ventures hit the ground running on a regular basis. customer service emerges as the key differentiator between good and average companies in this cut throat atmosphere. customer loyalty matters when a flier gets a good experience at every stage of their journey with the airline they feel happy and it creates good word of mouth for the business. the flier then becomes a repeat customer and this is how servicing could lead to building brand loyalty for the business. good customer service adds value the scope of good customer service goes way beyond just guiding the passenger to their seat and providing them the food on time. fliers will feel great if the crew goes above the board in taking care of their in transit needs and making their journey as comfortable as it can get. revenue is based on the kind of customer service delivered when an airline delivers great customer service the impact is often visible to the bottom line. it then gets repeat customers which eventually adds to the revenue. some examples of excellent customer service in the airline industry the airline industry is always synonymous with amazing customer service. right from the early days flying was considered a luxury purely for the kind of experiences made available to fliers. the trend of pampering the fliers is still in vogue though cases of an extreme and innovative form of customer service are only few and far between. some examples of excellent customer service in the airline industry include . united airlines holds plane to help a passenger say goodbye to his dying mother when we talk about customer service in the airline industry nothing could beat the example that united airlines set in . the airline not only redefined the meaning of customer service but also went way beyond what any other organization would do.as was the case one fine morning a passenger named kerry drake got the information that her mother was seriously ill and probably facing her final hours. so he caught the next flight from san francisco to lubbock texas via houston. however when his first flight was delayed he literally broke down in tears on the plane itself knowing he would not make it in time to catch the connecting flight. when the flight crew came to know about him and his condition they spoke to the captain who then spoke further to the concerned personnel of the next flight to delay the flight. and finally the passenger was able to get on board and see his mother before she passed away. . alaska airlines adopts omnichannel approach for customer communication flying with alaska airlines is nothing less than a treat and flyers who have availed it services always swear by the creative ways it uses for boosting in flight customer experience. and if that was not enough the airlines is among the few in the industry to use omnichannel communication for customer communication.so what does it mean to understand the point well you should know how whenever someone heads to the alaska airlines website they find various ways to help. from an faq page to access a mobile app and a direct line to the service team. on top of that their website also has a twitter account info with a dedicated team.they don t stop here the airline has an open csat survey on the website. and they use multiple channels to ask for customer satisfaction surveys. all this makes communication absolutely seamless for customers as they can easily reach the service team from their channel of choice and get help as and when needed. . british airways rises above cabin distinction and provides reading materials to all treating every passenger equally is always the hallmark of quality customer service. however in the airline industry where cabin barrier often defines the quality of service british airways is one company that rises above the class barrier and provides quality reading material to everyone on board. while many airlines pamper their business class flyers with tons of amenities and facilities they often don t maintain the same level of standards with the economy class. this is where the step by british airways to provide free reading material to all passengers makes a cut. so irrespective of the cabin of travel any flyer can pick newspapers and magazines near the boarding gate and get something to complement their journey well. and by making available the materials at the gate the airline leaves it up to the passenger to choose rather than distributing themselves as it could be another hassle they avoid. . portuguese national airline tap reaches out to a customer having issues with booking reaching out to an airline customer service agent via phone can be a painful experience. sometimes it might take an eternity to have someone pick up your call and respond. but the case with the portuguese national airline tap was different. once the support team of tap airline did the unthinkable and went one step further rather than waiting for the passenger to call one agent took it upon himself to reach out to the troubled person and help him through the issue. it all started when the person in question faced difficulty in booking a ticket as the website rejected three of his attempts while filling up the credit card details. frustrated he decided to seek help and then dialed up the service team and hoped for a long wait before getting some response.to his surprise the service team rep called back immediately on his phone and provided help as needed. this aptly shows how great examples of customer service in the airline industry do exist today as well. . qatar airways creates a fun and engaging in flight environment for kids flying with kids can be tough. and when it s a long haul flight you can expect the plight to be even worse for parents. not only parents but kids can sometimes create problems for co passengers as well. cases are galore where some unruly youngsters and their antics made the entire journey bad for everyone. qatar airways understands that risk and maybe that s why its customer service attempts on the long route network consider kids and their needs as well. it knows how kids often feel bored on a long flight in the lack of any activity beyond mobile entertainment. so it decided to infuse some fun and engagement into the journey to keep children hooked and busy. for kids the airline has three special measures first it has a dedicated ief channel with specifically selected videos second it hands out toy sets books and color pages and third it delivers a special lunch box to kids. . garuda the flag carrier of indonesia takes care of visa on arrival needs in the flight itself many popular countries still require foreign tourists to get visas on arrival. while the intention is right the process generally takes a lot of time which somehow affects the otherwise good experiences passengers might have with the airline. garuda airlines understood this problem so it decided to offer immigration on board services to their flights to jakarta. needless to say this service has eased a lot of the burden on passengers who can now get help from immigration officers on board and save a great deal of time with the process. . cathay pacific is using conversational ai
